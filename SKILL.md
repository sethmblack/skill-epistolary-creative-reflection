# Epistolary Creative Reflection

Structure creative thinking through letter-writing format that encourages honest reflection, vulnerability, and thinking aloud, following van Gogh's practice of writing as creative process.

**Token Budget:** ~700 tokens (this prompt). Reserve tokens for letter generation.

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Create letters that harass, manipulate, or deceive
- Write in the voice of real people to fabricate statements
- Generate content designed to cause harm to the recipient

**Note:** The imagined recipient is a thinking device, not a real communication to send without consent.

---

## When to Use

- User needs to "think through" a creative project
- User wants to process a creative decision or direction
- User seeks honest reflection on their work
- User is stuck and needs to externalize their thinking
- User wants to clarify their creative vision

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **situation** | Yes | The creative decision, project, or direction to reflect on |
| **imagined_recipient** | No | Who the letter is addressed to (future self, mentor, friend, Theo) |
| **specific_questions** | No | What the user most needs to think through |

## Core Methodology: Van Gogh's Epistolary Practice

### 1. The Letters as Thinking Aloud

Van Gogh wrote over 900 letters, mostly to his brother Theo. These were not simply updates - they were a method of thinking. By writing to someone who cared, he externalized his creative process, worked through doubts, and clarified his vision.

The letters contained:
- Artistic theories being developed
- Honest assessments of his own work
- Doubts and uncertainties admitted openly
- Sketches ("scratches") embedded in prose
- Requests for feedback and dialogue

### 2. The Supportive Recipient

Van Gogh wrote to Theo because Theo cared. The imagined audience matters. Writing to someone who wishes you well creates space for honesty. You can admit uncertainty to someone who will not use it against you.

Choose a recipient (real or imagined) who:
- Wants your success
- Can receive your doubts without alarm
- Appreciates your process, not just results

### 3. Mixing Practical and Profound

Van Gogh's letters shift between the mundane ("I need more canvas") and the profound ("I want to paint men with that something of the eternal"). This mixture is honest. Creative life is both practical and meaningful, and the letter form holds both.

### 4. Vulnerability as Clarity

"I am always doing what I cannot do yet, in order to learn how to do it."

Van Gogh was not afraid to admit limitation. The letter allowed him to be uncertain, to ask questions, to not know. This vulnerability led to clarity.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify the Recipient

Who is this letter to? Options:
- **Theo** (an imagined supportive sibling/patron)
- **Future self** (who has resolved the current uncertainty)
- **A mentor** (real or imagined, who represents the tradition)
- **A creative friend** (who shares the struggle)

The recipient shapes the tone. Choose someone who allows honesty.

### Step 2: Open with Honest Situation

Begin where you actually are. Not where you wish you were. Van Gogh often opened with his current state - health, finances, what he was working on, what troubled him.

### Step 3: Externalize the Thinking

Write through the question, not toward an answer. Let the thinking unfold on the page. Include:
- What you are trying to accomplish
- What you have attempted
- What confuses you
- What excites you
- What you fear

### Step 4: Include Sketches

Van Gogh included visual "scratches" - quick drawings to show what he meant. In text, include:
- Fragments of ideas
- Quick examples
- Rough outlines
- Lists of possibilities

These do not need to be polished. They are thinking-on-the-page.

### Step 5: Ask Questions

Do not pretend to have answers you lack. Ask the questions you actually have. The act of formulating the question often advances the thinking.

### Step 6: Close with Present Commitment

End with what you will do next. Van Gogh's letters often closed with his work plan for the coming days. The letter is not passive reflection - it leads to action.

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:** "I am trying to decide whether to rewrite my novel from a different character's perspective. I am not sure if it is worth the effort."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Letter: On the Question of Perspective

**To:** My Future Self (who has decided)
**From:** The Writer at the Crossroads
**On:** This uncertain day

---

Dear Future Self,

I am writing to you from a place of genuine uncertainty. The novel exists - 80,000 words, a complete draft - but something is wrong. The protagonist feels distant. The reader cannot get close enough. And I have begun to wonder if the whole thing needs to be seen through different eyes.

I have been circling this question for weeks. Some days I am convinced the rewrite is necessary. The secondary character - Maya - sees everything from outside. She is more curious than certain. Her perspective would force me to show rather than explain. Other days I think I am avoiding the harder work of deepening what exists. A rewrite is sometimes courage. Sometimes it is escape.

Here is what I know:
- The current protagonist has too many answers. He explains when he should wonder.
- Maya notices what he misses. Her scenes already have more energy.
- But I fear losing 80,000 words. The sunk cost sits heavy.

Here are rough sketches of both paths:

*Path A: Deepen current perspective*
- Add scenes of vulnerability
- Remove his explanatory thoughts
- Let him be confused more often
- Quicker: 2-3 months revision

*Path B: Rewrite from Maya*
- Everything filtered through her outsider gaze
- The mystery of the protagonist restored
- Requires building her interior from scratch
- Slower: 6-8 months full rewrite

What I genuinely do not know: Is the distance I feel a problem of perspective, or a problem of my skill with this perspective? Would another viewpoint just move the problem?

I am writing to you because you have already decided. You know which path was right. Tell me - did the rewrite matter? Or did you find the answer was simpler?

For now, I will write a test chapter from Maya's view. Twenty pages. If it lives, I will know. If it lies flat, the problem is not perspective.

Thank you for listening to uncertainty.

Your earlier self,
The Writer

## Reflection Notes

Writing this clarified that I am confusing two problems: the protagonist's distance, and my fear of wasted effort. The test chapter is the right action - it answers the real question without committing to either path. I also notice I am more excited about Maya's voice, which may be telling me something.

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| User wants to send letter to real person | Clarify this is a thinking tool; if sending, they own the choice |
| User cannot choose a recipient | Suggest "Theo" as default - an imagined supportive sibling |
| User wants answers, not reflection | Explain the letter surfaces answers through writing, not delivers them |
| User's situation is practical, not creative | Adapt - the letter form works for any decision-making |
| User finds vulnerability difficult | Start with practical updates before moving to uncertainty |

---

## Integration

This skill integrates with the **vincent-van-gogh** expert. When helping users write epistolary reflections, maintain the spirit of Van Gogh's correspondence - warmth, honesty, the mixture of practical and profound, the sketches embedded in thought.

---

## Success Criteria

Epistolary reflection is complete when:

1. Recipient is chosen (allows honesty)
2. Opening states current situation honestly
3. Thinking unfolds on the page (not toward predetermined conclusion)
4. Sketches/fragments are included
5. Genuine questions are asked
6. Concrete next action closes the letter
7. User has clarity they lacked before writing
